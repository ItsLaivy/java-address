/**
 * The {@code Host} class represents a combination of an address and an optional port.
 * It encapsulates information about a network host, which includes an address (e.g., a domain, an IP address,
 * or any other type of network identifier) and a port number. The main purpose of the {@code Host} class is to
 * provide a unified representation of network hosts, regardless of the specific type of address.
 * <p>
 * In networking, an address without a port does not fully specify a destination for communication,
 * as many services can be running on the same address (host) on different ports. The {@code Host} class
 * provides a way to associate an {@link Address} with a {@link Port}, ensuring that the destination can be
 * uniquely identified.
 *
 * <h2>Purpose and Usage</h2>
 * The {@code Host} class abstracts the concept of a network host, which can be used in various networking
 * contexts. By separating the concepts of address and port, it allows developers to work with network destinations
 * more flexibly and efficiently. This class supports different types of addresses (such as domains and IP addresses)
 * and provides methods for creating, validating, and manipulating host representations.
 *
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * Here is an example of how to create a {@code Host} instance using a domain name and a port:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Address address = Domain.parse("example.com");
 * Port port = new Port(8080);
 * Host host = new Host(address, port);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Note</h2>
 * The {@code Host} class does not impose any restrictions on the type of address. This allows the address to be
 * of any type that implements the {@link Address} interface, such as domain names, IP addresses, or even custom
 * implementations.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Host} class implements {@link Serializable} and {@link Cloneable}, allowing instances to be
 * serialized and cloned if needed.
